# Procesing-Sequencing-Data

Processing Next-Generation sequencing data is one of the most important tasks, yet it could be one of the most daunting tasks at the same time. For my master’s thesis, I have had an outstanding lab mate who helped me to develop the pipeline. Here, the processing means using compressed sequencing data sets to human readable format often using command line arguments on UNIX/LINUX operating systems. Results are comma separated value (.csv) files that can be opened in spreadsheet editor like Microsoft Excel. The figure below shows data analysis pipeline I have utilized for my master’s thesis.

In the figure, raw reads refer to "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) read length refers to the number of base pairs (bp) sequenced from a DNA fragment" (Source: Illumina)
